  Authorization:
Ensure that only logged-in users can create comments and see other users' posts.
Use the JWT token (stored in local storage) to authenticate requests to the backend API.


Testing:
Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected, including posting comments and owner comments on comments.
Remember to follow best practices for security and input validation to prevent common web application vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and you may need to adjust the steps based on your specific application structure and requirements. Additionally, adding new features to an existing application may require careful integration and testing to ensure everything works seamlessly together.
